- Repair paths in ModelFactory.cpp so that the app can load the shaders
- assimp and libktx ar compiled with vs2013, so in order to make the whole app work, neptune must be compiled in 2013 too.
- check if assimp and libktx are already available with conan (my guess is not)
- To be able co compile the app in 2017, libktx and assimp must be recompiled in 2017 too -> set up a nexus server with conan fetching from it
